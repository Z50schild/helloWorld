introduction to github

Hello world,

My name is Zefanja and I'm 28 years old.
I have studied medicine, but it's not for me. So I'm looking for a career change. 
I love logic puzzles and I love to create things. That's why I thought of programming.
I've made a start with Javascript, html and CSS on codecademy and freecodecamp, and started on SQL and Java, and so far I'm really enjoying it.
